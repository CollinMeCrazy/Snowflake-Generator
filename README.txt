PROJECT TITLE: Snowflake Generator OSC

PURPOSE OF PROJECT: Creates a random pixelated snowflake and can change the colors as it's being created using TouchOSC controls

VERSION or DATE: circa Spring 2023

HOW TO START THIS PROJECT: Before you start, make sure you have Processing v3.5.4 downloaded, Python mode installed, and oscP5 installed.
For this version of the snowflake generator, you will need the app on your phone called TouchOSC. It's free to download. 
You will want both your phone and your laptop/desktop to be on the same Wifi network. This will likely not work if you are on a public Wifi. 
Once you have the app, open it and navigate to connections. Click where it says OSC, and make sure Enabled is checked. You're then going to want to enter your Wifi's IP address.
You can find it easily by running the program first and look in the terminal for the output stream. For Port (outgoing) & (ingoing), enter 57112.
Make sure in the layout section you select Simple. You should be good to go now.
Hit done at the top right, use the first block in the top left, and the first three vertical sliders will change the color when the snowflake generator is running.

USER INSTRUCTIONS: Once the snowflake is being generated, you may use the three vertical sliders to change the color.
